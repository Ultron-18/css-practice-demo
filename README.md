# CSS Practice Demo

A simple layout project built with HTML and CSS to practice modern layout techniques and component styling.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was created to improve my understanding of:
- Flexbox layout systems
- Spacing, alignment, and positioning
- Responsive design techniques

It's a foundational demo focused on clean, organized code and visual layout structure — ideal for developing muscle memory with pure CSS.
